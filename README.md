## Motivations
Seizures are complex neural events with unpredictable dynamics, often linked to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Traditional approaches to understanding seizures have largely focused on classical neural models and empirical data analysis. However, quantum mechanics, with its probabilistic and dynamic nature, offers a new avenue for understanding these phenomena at a deeper, potentially more accurate level. By incorporating quantum models, we aim to investigate the intricate brain dynamics involved in seizure formation and potentially predict seizure onset with greater precision.

## Objectives
1. Capture Brain Dynamics Using Quantum Models
